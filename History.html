		<h1 style="text-align:center">About CIGM</h1>
		<p class="nfm1">The Ceylon and India General mission in short now called as CIG mission was founded in 1883 by a Christian business man Mr. Davidson who had a vision for the spiritual needs of Ceylon. This missionary movement met at the famous Keswick convention in July 1893 set out their journey by faith to Ceylon now called Sir Lanka and to India. In 1894 the missionaries moved to India. Initially the missionaries started in Tamil, Telugu speaking areas. In 1931 a head quarter became setup at Bangalore which is functioning even today. The work of CIGM extended thereafter to east and West Pakistan and Nepal. With much struggle and diabolic activities the CIGM could establish the kingdom of God around the globe.

<h1 style="text-align:center">The history of Kurichi church.</h1>
<p class="nfm1">
In the midst of the all odds these missionaries came to Kurichi during the year 1900 and started their good work. As usual in 1901, a school was opened and later and a church was established like any other area in Kurichi also. As our memory goes back it was Miss. Kenny who arrived at Kurichi in 1901 sowed the first seed of gospel and the people who came to the Lord remained faithful to God. As per the information taken from the biography of Mr. and Mrs. Dawson, Miss. Kenny by the grace of God started night schools in Tamil after much hard work in Kurichi she was able to win the heart of many souls for Christ and they started to worship the Lord. During this period in order to have the permanent place of worship, Rev. Merriweather approached the government and was able to get the place where we worship the Lord and it attained hundredth year celebration on 4th of April 2012. The Lord provided a permanent place of worship through the government officials, 17 souls baptized on 1917 and that was the first soldiers who joined in the army of god to march forward to establish a church in Kurichi. That was our first generation. After Dawson, in 1928 Miss. Elwood came as Missionary at Antiyur and she was taking care of our church. And in 1930 Mr. Maccarthy came to sathy which was our local headquarters at that time.   After this Rev. Merriweather came to sathiyamangalam and took charge after learning our Tamil language. Rev. Merriweather seeing the potential of the harvest in Kurichi. He devoted his life to improve the school and the church at Kurichi. Having learnt English and acquired some knowledge to read and write this converts became teachers and through the school they started assisting the missionary in the ministry. Mr. Sathiaynathan and Mr.Benjamin were the first pioneers who joined in this army to educate and elevate the status of our society in Kurichi. In the year 1943, there was another revival and many took baptism in the church at Kurichi.
Rev. Albert who is physically now no more with us has dedicated his life right from 1965 till 2007 nearly 42 years served earnestly, honestly and faithfully in this Kruichi church. From 1972 to 1974 Mr. Mrs. G.W. Worrells took charge at anthiyur they too were very enthusiastic about the growth of the ministry at Kurichi done by Rev. Albert. In 1970s it is heartening to note that it was our pride and pleasure that our beloved brother D.G.S Dinakaran ministered in our church many times during those years. In 1982 Rev. Raja. M. Selvaraj took charge of the mission field.

The first generation Christian Mr. Gnanamuthu though illiterate was the remarkable a strong believer who stood as the pillar and was considered as a prophet of that era because of power of God that was in him through the prayer. His prayers brought wonders and God used to answer his prayer through miracles. Right from 1970 to 2007 number of convention and spiritual meetings were conducted and through those meetings number of young people accepted Christ as their personal savior. After the demise of Rev. Albert, it is heartening to note that the mantle of the ministry have been taken over with the same amount of burden and carried out the responsibility by the three children of Rev. Albert and his wife.

We seek your prayer, support and cooperation for the further growth of our CIGM Merriweather Memorial church Kurichi, in all the fields specially in enriching our people spiritually and socially. We praise God for His faithfulness.
